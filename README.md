# Tenzie Game 
Tenzie is a captivating dice game where the goal is to roll all ten dice to the same number. It is a single-player game that provides an exciting and challenging experience.

In this digital adaptation of Tenzie developed using ReactJS, you will have ten dice at the start of the game. On your turn, you roll all the dice simultaneously. After the roll, you choose which dice landed on the desired number and set them aside. Then, you re-roll the remaining dice.

The objective is to repeat this process until all ten dice display the same number. It requires a mix of luck and decision-making to achieve the desired outcome. Your strategic choices on which dice to keep and when to re-roll can greatly influence your success.

# How It's Made:   
The Tenzie Game is developed using ReactJS, a popular JavaScript library for building user interfaces. The project follows a component-based architecture, where each component represents a different part of the game.

The game logic is implemented using JavaScript, while the user interface is built using React components. Styling is done using CSS, and the project is organized using modern development practices such as module bundling and package management with tools like Webpack and npm.

# Tech used:
